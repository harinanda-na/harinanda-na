## Self Introduction:
Hello,I am Harinandana MK of ELC department sem 1.
## Why must you choose me?
I am somebody who is excited and having an inordinate interest in learning new things.I was a biomath student in my 11th & 12th classes so i dont have any coding skills and only little knowledge 
about programming but have learned python before. So I have a  huge passion in learning coding to know more about it. So i can provide a dedicated support towards the club because i believe that 
learning new things and applying it to the work will make my contributions exceptional. I'll be putting forward all my passion dedication and support towards the growth of the club without any compromise.
## My goals for the next six months and how I'm going to accomplish them.
My next goals will be to gain knowledge and discover more about computer programming and to improve my technical knowledge which I hope that I'll be able to if I join the amfoss club and doing projects
which will improve my knowledge as well as benefit the works. I think that I'll be having newer goals if I gain more knowlwdge in computing skills.
## How will I contribute back to the club?
I can ensure that I'll be a very active member with all the support and commitment. I'll try my best to deal if problamastic situations arises.
